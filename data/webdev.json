Our goal was to create a scalable, full-stack application using a modern React front-end integrated with a robust Express back-end, addressing performance issues from the client's existing system. We utilized tools like Figma for design specifications and prototyping, ensuring our application closely resembled the provided mockups across all breakpoints. Task management was facilitated through a Jira Scrum board, allowing us to plan, track progress, and communicate effectively about hurdles and blockers. Leveraging technologies such as Node, MySQL, and Knex, alongside Git, GitHub, and npm, we ensured timely delivery of a functional and visually polished product that met all specified requirements without bugs",

Users can choose the grid size, and when they turn over a card, they aim to reveal either a dog or cat image. Revealing the dog image results in a loss, while uncovering the cat image leads to a win. We integrated APIs to fetch dog and cat images and used a random color API to assign vibrant colors to the cards, enhancing the visual appeal of the game.
